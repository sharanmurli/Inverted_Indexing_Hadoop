As per the homework description I tried running the Map Reduce Job on the Large Full Data Files but it didn't work on repl.it as well as Windows(WSL - Ubuntu). So I was able to run the Map Reduce Job for the Short Data Files. I have attached the screenshots for both the program outputs.

The short data input files used for both the Unigram and Bigram Task are specefied in this folder:
Input for the Unigram word count is in/fulldata
Input for the bigram word count is in/devdata

I have stored the output of the Map Reduce job in the below specefied folder:
Unigram - out/unigram
Bigram - out/bigram

Attachments include:
1.  Screenshot for the Unigram Map Reduce Job success and Bigram map Reduce Job Success along with the part-r0000 file
2. Java Code files for both(Unigram and Bigram) Map Reduce Jobs 
3. unigram_index.txt - For Unigram Output
4. specefic_bigram_index.txt - For Bigram Output
